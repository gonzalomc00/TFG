  <h2>Game modes</h2>
  <hr>
  <h3><strong>Single Player Mode</strong></h3>

  <p>In this mode you must answer 10 questions.</p>

  <p>To answer a question, you must fill in each ‘square’ with a letter that completes the answer. If
  you answer correctly, you will win 10 points. </p>

  <p>A timer will tell you the time you have to provide an answer for each question.</p>
  
  <p>If time runs out before you answer, you will not win any points and will lose a life. </p>

  <p>You have 5 lives available in this mode. You can use one life to skip questions that you are
  unable to answer, but you will not win any points if you do so.</p>
  
  <p>Once you have used up all your lives, if you provide an incorrect answer, you will be dropped
  from the game and lose.</p>

  <p>Scoring 100 points earns you a gold medal, 90 points earn you a silver medal and 80-70 points
  earn you a bronze medal.</p>

      answer. If time runs out before you answer, you will not win any points.</p>
